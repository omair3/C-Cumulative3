**Project Overview**:  
This project is Part 1 of a cumulative assignment to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for managing the Teachers table in a School Database using ASP.NET Core Web API and MVC. It focuses on **READ** functionality, allowing users to view a list of all teachers and details of a specific teacher through API endpoints and MVC web pages.

**What I Learned**:  
- How to connect a MySQL database to an ASP.NET Core application.  
- Building and testing Web API endpoints to retrieve data.  
- Creating dynamic MVC views for server-rendered web pages.  
- Structuring a project with models, controllers, and views.  
- Writing clear documentation and using descriptive variable names.  
- Testing APIs with cURL and verifying web page functionality.  
- Optional: Implementing error handling, search features, and basic styling.
